            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a recent mathematics graduate from MIT (2025) with research interests in low-dimensional topology and geometry. 
                My work focuses on knot theory, Heegaard Floer homology, and discrete geometric analysis on graphs. 
                I am currently applying to PhD programs for Fall 2025.

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
                My primary interests lie in low-dimensional topology, particularly knot theory and 3-manifold invariants. 
                I am especially interested in Heegaard Floer homology and its applications to detecting geometric structures. 
                I also have experience in discrete geometric analysis, where I have studied ancient solutions to heat equations on graphs.

            <h2>Selected Research Experience</h2>
            <h3>Visiting Student Researcher - Imperial College London (2025)</h3>
            <p>
                Working with Professor Steven Sivek on using pseudo-Anosov maps and branched coverings to investigate 
                whether Heegaard Floer homology detects the genus 3 torus knot T(2,5).

            <h3>Undergraduate Research - MIT Mathematics (2023)</h3>
            <p>
                Collaborated with Tang-Kai Lee to establish sharp bounds on spaces of ancient solutions to discrete heat equations 
                on weighted graphs, resulting in a publication in the Proceedings of the AMS.

            <h2>Publication</h2>
            <h3>Ancient caloric functions and parabolic frequency on graphs</h3>
            <p>With Tang-Kai Lee</p>
            <p class="date">Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, 2025</p>
            <p>
                We establish sharp bounds for spaces of ancient solutions to discrete heat equations on various weighted graphs, 
                developing new techniques in discrete geometric analysis with applications to understanding heat flow on networks.
